# python-fundamental-assignment
This repository contains all the programs I created during a crash course in Python programming. The project is divided into four sections:
Task 1: 
  Data Types - This section includes programs that demonstrate the basic data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Each data type has its own program showing how it works.
Task 2: 
  Control Structures - This program focuses on if-else statements and while loops in Python. It checks whether a user-input number is positive, negative, or zero.
Task 3: 
  Calculator - This is a simple calculator program that takes two numbers from the user and performs operations based on their choice.
Task 4:
  To-Do List App - The final program is a basic to-do list application that combines many concepts I learned in the course. It allows users to add, delete, and view tasks stored in a list, with options for user interaction.
